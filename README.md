- 👋 Hi, I’m @Akashleena Sarkar, aka Aleena. I am a robotics enthusiast.
- 👀 I’m interested in autonomous navigation of mobile robots and drones. I also love Human Robot Interaction.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Deep Learning, SLAM and improving my coding and development skills on C++ and system design.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to Deep Learning, SLAM or Deep Reinforcemeent Learning. I want to work on open source robotics project. In my free time, I like to meet Computer Science and robotics community over various conferences like the ROS Dev Day, or ICRA workshops. To have a little side income, I blog on Medium and do freelancing at UpWork.
